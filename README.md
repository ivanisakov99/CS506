# CS506 Computational Tools for Data Science
The goal of this course is to provide students a hands-on understanding of classical data analysis techniques and to develop proficiency in applying these 
techniques in modern programming languages (Python) while also learning about the social and ethical challenges of collecting and mining data by studying real 
world examples.

The course introduces students to a wide range of techniques that are commonly used in the analysis of data, such as clustering, classification, regression, and 
network analysis. Broadly speaking, the course breaks down into three main components, which we will take in order of increasing complication: (a) unsupervised 
methods; (b) supervised methods; and (c) methods for structured data.
